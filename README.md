# Data Modeling for Retail Sales 
# logical and Physical Design

### Step 1: Select the Business Process
- Identify the business process to model based on business requirements and available source data.
- Focus on the most critical and feasible process for the initial project.
- Example: Modeling POS retail sales transactions to analyze customer purchases.

### Step 2: Declare the Grain
- Decide the level of data detail for the dimensional model.
- Use the lowest atomic grain for maximum analytic flexibility and detailed dimensions.
- Example: Individual product on a POS transaction.

### Step 3: Identify the Dimensions
- Choose dimensions based on the grain of the fact table.
- Add dimensions if they naturally fit without violating the grain.
- Example dimensions: date, product, store, promotion, cashier, method of payment, and POS transaction ticket number.

### Step 4: Identify the Facts
- Determine which facts will appear in the fact table, ensuring they align with the grain.
- Example facts: sales quantity, regular price, discount price, net paid price, extended sales dollar amount, and extended discount dollar amount.
- Include additional facts if readily available, such as product cost.
